# Corpus Structure

The structure of the test corpora is derived from a general XML representation developed for use in RITEVAL, one of the tasks of the NII Testbeds and Community for Information access Research (NTCIR) project, as described at the following URL:

The RITEVAL format was developed for the general sharing of information retrieval on a variety of domains.
