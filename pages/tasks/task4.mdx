# Task 4

## Legal Textual Entailment<a name="task4"></a>

Our goal is to construct Yes/No question answering systems for legal queries, by entailment from the relevant articles. If a 'Yes/No' legal bar exam question is given, your legal information retrieval system retrieves relevant Civil Law articles. Then, the task investigates the performance of systems that answer 'Yes' or 'No' to previously unseen queries by comparing the meanings between queries and your retrieved Civil Law articles. Training data consists of triples of a query, relevant article(s), a correct answer "Y" or "N". Test data will include only queries and relevant articles, but no 'Y/N' label.

There should be no human intervention at any stage, including modifications to your retrieval system motivated by an inspection of the queries. You should not materially modify your retrieval system between the time you downloaded the queries and the time you submit your runs.

At most three runs for each group should be assessed. The submission format and evaluation methods are described below.
