          We will publish COLIEE papers in one of two categories according to the quality of the papers:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Proceedings in LNAI series by Springer Verlag which will (electronically) be distributed at the COLIEE workshop
          </li>
          <li>
            Local Proceedings published by IsAI-JSAI (parent symposium of JURISIN 2024) for papers which are not qualified for LNAI publication, but are selected to be presented at the COLIEE workshop.

          Participants should clearly mention what dataset was used (for example: pretrained by Wikipedia dump data as of 2022xxxx, fine-tuned by...) for reproducibility purposes. Participants can use any external data, but it is assumed that they do not use the test dataset and/or something which could directly contain the correct answers of the test dataset.

            Task 1
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            For Task 1, a submission should consist of a single ASCII text file. Use a single space to separate columns, with three columns per line as follows:

              <li>The third column is called the "run tag" and should be a unique identifier for the submitting group, i.e., each run should have a different tag that identifies the group. Please restrict run tags to 12 or fewer letters and numbers, with no punctuation.</li>

            Submission format in Task 3 is the TREC eval format used in trec_eval program. Use a single space to separate columns, with six columns per line as follows:

              <li>The first column is the query id.</li>
              <li>The second column is "iter" for trec_eval and not used in the evaluation. Information of the column will be ignored. But please write Q0 in this column.</li>

              <li>The third column is called the "run tag" and should be a unique identifier for the submitting group, i.e., each run should have a different tag that identifies the group. Please restrict run tags to 12 or fewer letters and numbers, with no punctuation.</li>
